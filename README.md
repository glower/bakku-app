# Bakku-app: windows/linux backub service

This is my fun project to get some practice in golang. The idea is to store changed files automatically to some cloud or whatever is emplemented as a storage provider. I use native windows/linux API to get notifications on file changes (using CGO).

This version is unstable and under development, don't use it for anything

TODO (more like idea list):
- [ ] write good readme
- [ ] write storage plugin for S3
- [ ] write REST endpoints for updating configuration
- [ ] write GUI in electron for displaying progress
